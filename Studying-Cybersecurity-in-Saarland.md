# Studying Cybersecurity in Saarland

Tips for newcomers (esp Indian students) who are either in Saarland or are planning to apply for the Cyber Security Master courses at the University 

# Background
Many prospective and admitted students contact me on LinkedIn and through my friends' cirlce as they onboard to Saarland University. I found that most of them have similar questions and they usually resolve around the first semester at the University. As someone who had to personally go through the ordeal of figuring out how things work at Saarland, I try to guide them as much as I could. Recently, I felt it is better to write some tips down so that advice can be made available to a larger set of fellow students. 

Thanks to my friends in particular, Vikram, Peter, .... for contributing to the topics. There were many obvious ones I had forgotten about until they pointed it out. 

# Before joining 
- Try to learn German. It's a tough language but if you can at least speak it well enough to talk to a call center agent, your life in Saarbrücken will be much easier. 
- Try to learn a programming language like python and any web development framework. Some assignments require you to have these skills. While it is possible to learn it during the assignment or project, your valueable time is better spent on achiveing the objectives of the task than studying a new language. 

# Stay
Using online portals are good to connect with property owners that want to lease out their accommodation but getting in touch with existing students using FB groups is invaluable as they know if an rooms are there to be rented in their complex. Depending on your budget and needs, you can look at the slightly more expensive city side or the cheaper & more affordable part of town 'Dudweiler' which is barely a 10 min bus ride from the Uni.

# What to get  
Do Get:
Apart from all the important stuff and personal belongings that you need consider getting :
* Rice cooker / pressure cooker. - These will be your best friends for the years in saarbrucken.
* Common Indian Masalas - Depending on which part of the country you are from, get your favourite masalas, pickles, flavour mixes etc (Haldi, Corriander powder, red chilli being the most basic) - Dont get too much as most masalas you can find in the Indian store. This is just for the initial days.
* Tawa or flat pan - If you plan to cook rotis or make dosas. 
* Medicines - Most important of the lot. Carry medicines according to your general and specific needs. Medicines expire quicker than we think so make sure you check the dates. Try to carry 3 strips of Vitamin D3 (D-Rise) with 60K IU of Vitamin D and take one tablet every 4 weeks to maintain levels (Please consult your family doctor beforehand). Get a blood profile before travel to figure this.

What you can avoid getting:
* Please avoid getting plates, spoons, glasses etc as these items are heavy and can be bought very reasonably from store like rossmann, tedi (feel free to ckeck them out online). The cost of carrying them from India is much more in our experience. Travel light. ## More stuff != More convenience ##
* Most masalas you can get at the Indian store so consider carrying custom flavour mixes or home made masalas as MDH, Shaan etc are available.

# Bank account 
Easy. Just go to Santander next to the Welcome Center. The person sitting there speaks English and will explain everything for you. 
Key advantages : It is fully online, no transfer limits (good from auslander's perspective when you need to show a blocked account), support in english from the branch at uni.
# Insurance (below 35 years of age) 
There are a few insurance options in Germany to choose from but the only one we can recommend is TK. The TK office is right at the welcome center and is processed in minutes. The document from the insurance company is a mandate for enrollment at the Uni so make sure the payments are always made and if there is any processing error, get it rectified. 
Key advantages : TK covers health and dental, cashless, just swipe and get treated, need to pay only a small processing fee after usage, proper english support channels for expats, used by most as it is reliable.

# Insurance (above 35 years of age - private insurance) 


# Internet 
Internet in Germany takes time! Please expect from the time of application to the time a working internet connection is established to your place of residence it is going to take a few weeks(you heard it right!). Prefer accomodations with wifi in place else talk to neighbours and figure if sharing is a good alternative. Companies like O2, 1&1, vodafone all have ISP services but depending on your address any one may be available, If thats the case go in for a student plan with the company after reading the usage contract properly as some may require change of address proof or exmatriculation from the uni to end the contract.

# Easy courses 
Easiness is relative. There are no real easy subjects in a German university. They all test how much you understood and the questions in the final exam are genrally designed to test your ability to use your understanding to solve a problem or apply to a scenario. Quite different from the mindless rote learning that we are exposed to back in India. Nonetheless, I have graded them based (.... criteria to be filled...) 

* German Language
* Perspectives in Cyber Security (great if you ever thought of building a startup/ product of your own) 
* Data networks 
* Ethics for Nerds 
* IT Forensics
* Distributed graph algorithm 
* Secure Web Development
* Cryptography 
* Security Core - make sure you thoroughly understand the buffer overflow, functions and stack portion. Try practice questions from the internet. During tutorials ask for more demonstrations so that you really grasp the theory and you can solve the problems. Ask for more sample problems during tutorial. 
* Usable Security - Statistical course lead by a good professor.
