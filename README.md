# Studying Cybersecurity in Saarland

Tips for newcomers (esp Indian students) who are either in Saarland or are planning to apply for the Cyber Security Master courses at the University 

# Background
Many prospective and admitted students contact me on LinkedIn and through my friends' cirlce as they onboard to Saarland University. I found that most of them have similar questions and they usually resolve around the first semester at the University. As someone who had to personally go through the ordeal of figuring out how things work at Saarland, I try to guide them as much as I could. Recently, I felt it is better to write some tips down so that advice can be made available to a larger set of fellow students. 

Thanks to my friends in particular, Vikram, Peter, .... for contributing to the topics. There were many obvious ones I had forgotten about until they pointed it out. 

# Before joining 
- Try to learn German. It's a tough language but if you can at least speak it well enough to talk to a call center agent, your life in Saarbrücken will be much easier. 
- Try to learn a programming language like python and any web development framework. Some assignments require you to have these skills. While it is possible to learn it during the assignment or project, your valueable time is better spent on achiveing the objectives of the task than studying a new language. 

# Stay

# Bank account 
Easy. Just go to Santander next to the Welcome Center. The person sitting there speaks English and will explain everything for you.

# Easy courses 
Easiness is relative. There are no real easy subjects in a German university. They all test how much you understood and the questions in the final exam are genrally designed to test your ability to use your understanding to solve a problem or apply to a scenario. Quite different from the mindless rote learning that we are exposed to back in India. Nonetheless, I have graded them based (.... criteria to be filled...) 

* German Language
* Perspectives in Cyber Security (great if you ever thought of building a startup/ product of your own) 
* Data networks 
* Ethics for Nerds 
* IT Forensics
* Distributed graph algorithm 
* Secure Web Development
* Cryptography 
* Security Core - make sure you thoroughly understand the buffer overflow, functions and stack portion. Try practice questions from the internet. During tutorials ask for more demonstrations so that you really grasp the theory and you can solve the problems. Ask for more sample problems during tutorial. 

Only available for the Entrepreneurial stream: 

* Digital Entrepreneurship

If you think you need counselling or feel like talking to a mental health professional, you can approach the Psychologisch-Psychotherapeutische Beratungsstelle des Studentenwerkes im Saarland e.V. group at the University.

# Full time jobs and blue card process 

I have not found the CV format to be of much importance. Cover letter is quite important. For job search I relied on:
