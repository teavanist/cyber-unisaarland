# Studying Cybersecurity in Saarland

Tips for newcomers (esp Indian students) who are either in Saarland or are planning to apply for the Cyber Security Master courses at the University 

# Before joining 
- Try to learn German. It's a tough language but if you can at least speak it well enough to talk to a call center agent, your life in Saarbr√ºcken will be much easier. 
- Try to learn a programming language like python and any web development framework. Some assignments require you to have these skills. While it is possible to learn it during the assignment or project, your valueable time is better spent on achiveing the objectives of the task than studying a new language.
