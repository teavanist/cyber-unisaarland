# Studying Cybersecurity in Saarland

Tips for newcomers (esp Indian students) who are either in Saarland or are planning to apply for the Cyber Security Master courses at the University 

# Background
Many prospective and admitted students contact me on LinkedIn and through my friends' cirlce as they onboard to Saarland University. I found that most of them have similar questions and they usually resolve around the first semester at the University. As someone who had to personally go through the ordeal of figuring out how things work at Saarland, I try to guide them as much as I could. Recently, I felt it is better to write some tips down so that advice can be made available to a larger set of fellow students. 

# Before joining 
- Try to learn German. It's a tough language but if you can at least speak it well enough to talk to a call center agent, your life in Saarbr√ºcken will be much easier. 
- Try to learn a programming language like python and any web development framework. Some assignments require you to have these skills. While it is possible to learn it during the assignment or project, your valueable time is better spent on achiveing the objectives of the task than studying a new language.
